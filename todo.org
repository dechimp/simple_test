*** Functionality
*** Usability
*** Performance
*** (time permitting) Accessibility
** RTM or some substitute for it
**** Change the category for an expense
**** Log in
**** Export transactions
** Test environment requirements
*** Chrome
*** FF
*** IE
** Automation feasability
*** Full automation.  At the end of automation we can run tests again 
    manually to compare the experience.
* Test planning
** Estimates
   :spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At_H7Jo-5SsWdHV1YjBZWlhHa0ZQZnVYa1RTMVJLekE#gid=0
** Scope
** Tools / Languages
*** Selenium
*** Watir
*** Rspec
*** Capybara
*** Google Robot Framework
*** Cucumber
*** YAML
** Timeline/schedule
** Test plan
* Test case development
** Create testing repo and directories
** Install dependencies for writing / running automated test cases
   :time_taken: 1hr
*** ruby, cucumber, json, nokogiri, gherkin
*** TODO Install factoryGirl
*** DONE Create gemfile
*** DONE Install Watir
** Test cases
*** Log_in
**** DONE Selenium
     sure seems ugly compared to capybara
***** DONE Via IDE
**** DONE Rspec / Capybara
     :status: integrating YAML
     :Had to incorporate Selenium (`, :js => true`) to get 
     :the test to run in a live browser
***** which do I write first?
***** rspec without rails?
      sure. I did it.
**** DONE Watir 
***** DONE Plus cucumber?
       cucumber doesnt work in ruby 1.9.3.  I used ruby 1.9.2.
**** TODO Google Robot Framework
     not a big fan of their documentation.  Just seems like a tool too complex 
     for the majority of tasks
**** TODO iMacros
*** Verify elements on the page
*** Export transactions
** Test data
*** DONE YAML
*** TODO FactoryGirl for rspec
**** Create data
* BDD?
* Environment setup
* Test execution
** Running a suite of tests with
*** RSpec / Selenium
*** RSpec / Capybara
*** Watir
*** Google Robot Framework
** Running headless
* Closure
** Export this process to my notes
** Questions
*** Should I debug test cases during development or during execution?
*** If, say, I decide I like Capybara, can I toss in selenium or even watir stuff in 
    the same files as my Capybara stuff?
*** Which tests are the fastest?  Why are others slow compared to it?
** Create a snippet of a framework that I can deploy for future projects
** Create a directory structure that can be used for future similar projects
