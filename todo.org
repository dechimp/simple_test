*** Functionality
*** Usability
*** Performance
*** (time permitting) Accessibility
** RTM or some substitute for it
**** Change the category for an expense
**** Log in
**** Export transactions
** Test environment requirements
*** Chrome
*** FF
*** IE
** Automation feasability
*** Full automation.  At the end of automation we can run tests again 
    manually to compare the experience.
* Test planning
** Estimates

     :status: integrating YAML
     :Had to incorporate Selenium (`, :js => true`) to get 
     :the test to run in a live browser
***** which do I write first?
***** rspec without rails?
      sure. I did it.
**** DONE Watir 
***** DONE Plus cucumber?
       cucumber doesnt work in ruby 1.9.3.  I used ruby 1.9.2.
**** TODO Google Robot Framework
**** TODO iMacros
*** Export transactions
** Test data
*** DONE YAML
*** TODO FactoryGirl for rspec
**** Create data
* BDD?
* Environment setup
* Test execution
** Running a suite of tests with
*** Selenium
*** RSpec / Capybara
*** Watir
*** Google Robot Framework
** Running headless
* Closure
** Export this process to my notes
** Questions
*** Should I debug test cases during development or during execution?
*** Which tests are the fastest?  Why are others slow compared to it?
** Create a snippet of a framework that I can deploy for future projects
** Create a directory structure that can be used for future similar projects
